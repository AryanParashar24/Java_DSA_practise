public class BubbleSort {

/*    By this we do sorting bubble sort algorithm is one of them in which we actually sort by just comapring the values one by one and then after for example we have 4
    as 3,1,6,7,5 then in this we will end up by comparing and swaping the values one by one and ends up getting a series as 1,3,6,5,7 by this we can clearly see that
    it  isn't the sorted array we were looking for but we found the largest number in the end for our array for which we can use as the last letter is sorted so the end
    can be just shifted one letter forward and thus we will find the perfect array we were looking for in the end of all the rounds and the :-----

    the Number of steps it might have gone through is n - 1 in the worst case(number of letters as n)and then after every round the number of steps for adding up one more number to the sorted
    array will reduce the number of steps by 1 more time from the total so will give take n -2 in the worst case and so on.........*/
